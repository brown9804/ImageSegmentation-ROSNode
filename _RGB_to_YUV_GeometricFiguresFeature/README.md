----------

This project is a feature of the main project that has already had the functionality added. It was specifically designed for ROS Node. It focuses on the conversion between RGB and YUV color spaces and the representation of different geometric figures such as linear segments, circles, and triangles.

## Features

- **RGB to YUV conversion**: This feature allows for the conversion of images from the RGB color space to the YUV color space.
- **Geometric Figure Representation**: This feature enables the representation of various geometric figures such as linear segments, circles, and triangles.
